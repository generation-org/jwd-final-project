# Flex Tasks: Optional Extras

## Description

You may be at the end of your project looking for more to do, or halfway through with some extra time. These are all **optional** tasks that should only be completed if there is time remaining or you feel the need to contribute in other areas.

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Create a README.md file for your github page

>#### Useful Resources for this step
> - [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
> - [Readme Badges](https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges)

1. Add a file with the name `README.md` in the root folder of your github page.
2. Create some meaningful messages that will inform the reader about the app. 
3. Style with either html or markdown, add in some images if you want! 

### Step 2: The final presentation

The presentation will be no longer than 10 minutes. 

1. Create a demonstration of the app as if you were a user. 
2. Talk through any issues faced and how you solved them.
3. Practice the presentation and time yourself to make sure you are within the allocated time limit. 

### Step 3: Task App design

Now is your chance to go back to the design stage and wireframe ideas. As with all software products, there will be multiple iterations and changes throughout the entire project. Spend some time making your app look good!  

>#### Useful Resources for this step
> - [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
> - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
> - [CSS Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference)
> - [Custom CSS Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

1. Take a look at the [display: flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) property in CSS. Try to use [Bootstrap's inline utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/) to display your content the way you want it. 
2. Check to see if any more of your CSS can be used inline with [Bootstrap's inline utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/).  
3. Try incorporating  your own logo / brand / colour patterns to match throughout the app. Try using [Custom CSS Properties (Variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to replace *hardcoded* values. 
4. Try out the Chrome dev tools `toggle device toolbar` and view your app as if you were on a mobile device. Refer to Bootstrap's layout utilities, such as the [Responsive Breakpoint Section](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints)

### Step 4: Semantics 

>#### Useful Resources for this step
> - [MDN Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)

1. Refactor your `index.html` file to use semantically correct HTML.
2. Refactor your `style.css` file to use semantically correct CSS.
3. Refactor your `index.js` and `taskManager.js` file to use semantically correct JS. Don't forget your `createHtml` function in the `TaskManager` class. 
4. Create or edit your code comments to show meaningful messages. 

### Step 5: Accessibility

>#### Useful Resources for this step
> - [MDN Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)
> - [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)

1. Test your app as if you were a user with a concious effort to incorporate accessibility aspects. 
2. Run the Chrome dev tools Lighthouse tests. 
3. Add in missing elements such as image descriptions and `alt` tags. Make sure your form works with just a keyboard. 

### Step 6: ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)

>#### Useful Resources for this step
> - [MDN JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

1. Refactor your `index.js` and `taskManager.js` files to use ES6 aspects such as 
  - [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
  - [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) 
  - [Aary methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#instance_methods)

 ### Step 7: Favicon and Metadata

>#### Useful Resources for this step
