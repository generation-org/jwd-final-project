## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Implement the task Card layout

In this step, we'll create a basic structure of a card with the task's information. This will be used as a template that we will later fill in from our form using javascript. But for now, we will *hardcode* it! 

1. Add a new sample [card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/) to the `index.html`
2. Add field inside the card for the task name.
3. Add field inside the card for the task description.
4. Add field inside the card for who the task is assigned to.
5. Add field inside the card for the task due date.
6. Add field inside the card for the task status.

### Step 2: Implementing a tasks list

1. Add a [list group](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/list-group/) to the `index.html`
2. Add your sample task inside the list

### Step 3: Adding your sample data

1. Create 5 different task examples
2. Add each of your 5 cards inside the list group

 #### Test Your Code!
 Now is a good chance to test your page, open your `index.html` on your favourite browser or run `open index.html` from your terminal inside the final-project folder


## Results

We've now created the basic structure to represent a list of tasks. We will eventually take these out and replace it with whatever the user inputs into the form. But to check the styling and compatibility let's just keep them like this for the time being.
